# Sound Transmission Class (STC)

A Python tool for calculating **Sound Transmission Class (STC)** according to ASTM E413 standard.  
This project helps analyze the acoustic performance of partition materials based on measured **Sound Transmission Loss (STL)** data.

---

## Features
- Calculate **STC rating** from Transmission Loss (TL) values.
- Support for **ASTM E413 standard** calculation.
- Plot TL vs frequency curve with STC contour line.
- Easy-to-use function for quick calculation and visualization.
